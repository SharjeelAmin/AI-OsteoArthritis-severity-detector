# AI-OsteoArthritis-severity-detector

This project was created by UTD CS AI Research Students. This project can accurately predit if someone has osteoarthritis and the severety level (kl_grade). We used a combination of 1500+ images and 10,000+ rows of tabular data to complete this. This is just a starting point and we will be updating this project.
